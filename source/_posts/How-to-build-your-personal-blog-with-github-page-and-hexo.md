## Why Blog?

Simply speaking, recording your valuable thinking in the form of a blog brings many benefits without any obvious disadvantages.  

Because: 

> 1. You can know many like-minded people with you when you read and discuss each other's blogs.
>
> 2. Writing is for better thinking.
>
> 3. Teaching is the best way of leaning. If you cannot make a clear statement, you probably don't fully understand it.

## Create a repository on github

Create a repository on your [github](<https://github.com/>), caution: you must create a repository named:    

â€‹			***YourUserName.github.io***

*If you don't know how to create a repository, follow this: [Create a repo](https://help.github.com/en/articles/create-a-repo)*.

## Build your environment

I will introduce the steps on windows, if you are using a Mac, you can see this: [How To Build A Blog With Hexo](<https://commitlogs.com/2016/09/03/how-to-build-blog-with-hexo/>).

### Install git

* Download the suitable version Git for Windows Setup with your computer from the official site: [Git - Downloading Package](<https://git-scm.com/download/win>).

* Install Git.

* Test the Git installation with `git` command in cmd.

* Link your Git with your github account:

  * open cmd with as an administrator

  * set the user.name and user.email

    ```
    git config --global user.name YourGithubUserName
    git config --global user.email YourGithubEmail
    ```

  * generate the ssh key file

    ```
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -C YourGithubEmail
    ```

    press the Enter for three times

  * find the generated id_rsa.pub file, copy the whole content

  * Open [GitHub_Settings_keys](https://github.com/settings/keys), choose New SSH key, paste the key in the Key blank, fill in the Title blank with anything, choose Add SSH key.

  * test the linage in cmd

    ```
    ssh git@github.com
    ```

    If you see the welcome message, eg:

    ```
    Hi XXX! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
    Connection to github.com closed.
    ```

    Congratulations!

* You have successfully set your Git, you can manage your github repositories with Git on your computer.

### Install Node.js

* Download Node.js at the offical website: [Download | Node.js](<https://nodejs.org/en/download/>)
* After installation, use `node -v` in cmd to check node.js.
* use `npm -v` in cmd to check npm (installed with node.js)

### Install Hexo

[Hexo](<https://github.com/hexojs/hexo>) is:

> A fast, simple & powerful blog framework, powered by [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). 

We can easily  create and manage our blog with hexo.

* Make a folder (eg. MyBlog), cd to it in cmd

* Install hexo with npm

  ```
  npm install hexo-cli -g
  ```

## Initialize the blog

- Set up your blog

  ```
  hexo init blog
  cd blog
  ```

- Generate static files

  ```
  hexo g
  ```

- Start the server (run the blog with local server, usually for test)

  ```
  hexo s
  ```

- Visit localhost:4000 (the ip address shown in the return message in cmd), we can see the initial form of a hexo bolg.

## Deploy the blog

We are now running the blog at local server, in the next step, we are going to deploy it to github, so that your blog can be visited anywhere with Internet access.

Firstly, we need to know about the site configuration file: `_config.yml` (under the root folder of blog),  we can config the characteristics of our blog by modifying this file.

* Open site configuration file, find 'deploy', modify the deploy block to:

  ```
  deploy:
  	type: git
  	repo: https://github.com/YourUserName/YourUserName.github.io.git
  	branch: master
  ```

* Save site configuration file.

* Install Git-deployer plugin:

  ```
  npm install hexo-deployer-git --save
  ```

* Clean, generate and deploy the blog

  Remind the following commands, you need to use them (or replace `hexo d` with `hexo s` for local test) every time you make changes to your blog:

  ```
  hexo clean
  hexo g
  hexo d
  ```

  > `hexo d` is the deploy command in hexo

* If everything goes correctly, you can now access your blog on Internet at: ***YourUserName.github.io***

## Choose a theme

There are hundreds of themes for hexo, you can access them at: https://hexo.io/themes/.

**Next** is a popular blog theme because its simply yet elegant UI, I will take this theme as example.

* Open the Command Prompt at the root folder of blog (which includes /source and /theme, etc.)

* Clone the theme:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/theme-next/hexo-theme-next themes/next
  ```

*
