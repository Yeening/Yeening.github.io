## *Why Blog?

Simply speaking, recording your valuable thinking in the form of a blog brings many benefits without any obvious disadvantages.  

Because: 

> 1. You can know many like-minded people with you when you read and discuss each other's blogs.
>
> 2. Writing is for better thinking.
>
> 3. Teaching is the best way of leaning. If you cannot make a clear statement, you probably don't fully understand it.
