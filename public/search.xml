    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Why Blog?Simply speaking, recording your valuable thinking in the form of a blog brings many benefits without any obvious disadvantages. Because: You can know many like-minded people with you when you read and discuss each other’s blogs. Writing is for better thinking. Teaching is the best way of leaning. If you cannot make a clear statement, you probably don’t fully understand it. — WeiPeng’s Blog Create a repository on githubCreate a repository on your github, caution: you must create a repository named: ​ YourUserName.github.io If you don’t know how to create a repository, follow this: Create a repo. Build your environmentI will introduce the steps on windows, if you are using a Mac, you can see this: How To Build A Blog With Hexo. Install git Download the suitable version Git for Windows Setup with your computer from the official site: Git - Downloading Package. Install Git. Test the Git installation with git command in cmd. Link your Git with your github account: open cmd with as an administrator set the user.name and user.email 12git config --global user.name YourGithubUserNamegit config --global user.email YourGithubEmail generate the ssh key file 1ssh-keygen -t rsa -C YourGithubEmail press the Enter for three times find the generated id_rsa.pub file, copy the whole content Open GitHub_Settings_keys, choose New SSH key, paste the key in the Key blank, fill in the Title blank with anything, choose Add SSH key. test the linage in cmd 1ssh git@github.com If you see the welcome message, eg: 12Hi XXX! You&apos;ve successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.Connection to github.com closed. Congratulations! You have successfully set your Git, you can manage your github repositories with Git on your computer. Install Node.js Download Node.js at the offical website: Download | Node.js After installation, use node -v in cmd to check node.js. use npm -v in cmd to check npm (installed with node.js) Install HexoHexo is: A fast, simple &amp; powerful blog framework, powered by Node.js. We can easily create and manage our blog with hexo. Make a folder (eg. MyBlog), cd to it in cmd Install hexo with npm 1npm install hexo-cli -g Initialize the blog Set up your blog 12hexo init blogcd blog Generate static files 1hexo g Start the server (run the blog with local server, usually for test) 1hexo s Visit localhost:4000 (the ip address shown in the return message in cmd), we can see the initial form of a hexo bolg. Deploy the blogWe are now running the blog at local server, in the next step, we are going to deploy it to github, so that your blog can be visited anywhere with Internet access. Firstly, we need to know about the site configuration file: _config.yml (under the root folder of blog), we can config the characteristics of our blog by modifying this file. Open site configuration file, find ‘deploy’, modify the deploy block to: 1234deploy: type: git repo: https://github.com/YourUserName/YourUserName.github.io.git branch: master Save site configuration file. Install Git-deployer plugin: 1npm install hexo-deployer-git --save Clean, generate and deploy the blog Remind the following commands, you need to use them (or replace hexo d with hexo s for local test) every time you make changes to your blog: 123hexo cleanhexo ghexo d hexo d is the deploy command in hexo If everything goes correctly, you can now access your blog on Internet at: YourUserName.github.io Choose a themeThere are hundreds of themes for hexo, you can access them at: https://hexo.io/themes/. Next is a popular blog theme because its simply yet elegant UI, I will take this theme as example. Open the Command Prompt at the root folder of blog (the folder which includes /source and /theme, etc.) Clone the theme to the folder: /themes/themename: 1git clone https://github.com/theme-next/hexo-theme-next themes/next Open the site configuration file: _config.yml,change the value of theme to next (the name of theme) 1theme: next Clean, generate and deploy the blog 123hexo cleanhexo ghexo d For more settings with the theme next, refer to its repository: https://github.com/theme-next/hexo-theme-next , or its documentation: https://theme-next.org/docs/, if you are a beginner, it’s good to start with next because of its detailed users’ guide Write a post You can create a new post with this command: 1hexo new &quot;My post title&quot; or: 1hexo n &quot;My post title&quot; Hexo will generate a markdown file named: My post title.md under path: /source/_posts, you can easily write and edit your post by editing this file. If you don’t know what is or how to write markdown, you can learn from here: https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started You can create a new page with this command: 1hexo new page &quot;About&quot; Bind a domain name (Optional)It is okey to leave your blog adress as YourUserName.github.io, and it’s cool to own your personalized domain name, if you want to bind your blog with your own domain name, follow the following steps: Get a domain namePersonally, I buy my domain name at ALi Cloud, but it’s up to you. Set up the domain nameThe steps of setting a domain name varies with your domain name and its provider, so I will skip the detail, you can follow the official guide from github: https://help.github.com/en/articles/quick-start-setting-up-a-custom-domain Create a CNAME fileCreate a file named CNMAE under folder /source, type in your domain name, you can type in your domain name without www, so that your site can be visited via a domain name either include www or not.
